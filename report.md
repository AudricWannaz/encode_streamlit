## Goals
1) explore the toy dataset and find out the most popular words uttered by different speakers
2) write a streamlit app that would allow to choose a speaker and a play

## Instruments
1) pandas: for dataframe manipulation, selecting subset of a dataframe
2) cltk: to get the list of stopwords for Greek
3) streamlit: to make an app

## Results

The app allows to select a play and then presents a dropdown of the speakers (only those actually speaking in the play the user selected). It then presents the user with the table of top 20 favourite words of this speaker, with the exclusion of stopwords. 

## Fails

1) I couldn't deploy the app yet, something went wrong with my gitlab.
2) I wanted to include a scatter plot but I was already being late for the aperitivo.
